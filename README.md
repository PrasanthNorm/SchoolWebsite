## Getting Started

### For Students
1. Start by exploring the existing files:
   - `index.html` - The homepage of the Amul Edutech website
   - `pages/about.html` - Example of an inner page about Amul Edutech
   - `pages/contact.html` - Example of a contact page with a form

2. Create the remaining HTML pages following the structure of the example pages.

3. Add your own content and images to make the website unique.

4. Test your website by opening the HTML files in a web browser.

### Learning Phases

#### Phase 1: HTML Structure (Current Phase)
In this first phase, focus on creating the structure of all pages using HTML only. Don't worry about styling yet - that will come in later phases. Concentrate on:
- Creating well-structured HTML documents
- Using appropriate semantic elements
- Organizing content logically
- Building forms and tables where needed

#### Phase 2: Adding CSS (Coming Later)
After mastering HTML structure, you'll learn to add styling using CSS to make your website visually appealing.

### HTML Elements to Practice
- Document structure (`<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
- Paragraphs (`<p>`)
- Links (`<a>`)
- Images (`<img>`)
- Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`)
- Tables (`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`)
- Forms (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`)
- Semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`)

## Project Tasks for Students

### Phase 1 Tasks (HTML Structure)
1. Complete the homepage structure with all necessary sections for Amul Edutech
2. Create basic inner pages (about, courses, contact)
3. Build a contact form with various input types for course inquiries
4. Create a table for course schedule or program details
5. Implement proper navigation between all pages

## Tips for Teachers
- Start by explaining the overall structure of the Amul Edutech website
- Demonstrate how to create new pages based on the existing templates
- Emphasize the importance of semantic HTML elements
- Explain how to organize content in a logical way
- Encourage students to validate their HTML using online validators
- Discuss how the website structure reflects Amul Edutech's educational technology focus
